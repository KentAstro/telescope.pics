The purpose of this website is to share the results of my lifelong interest in astrophotography! I've been interested in astronomy since my teen years, and spent decades juggling an engineering career with skywatching. In 1996, when Comet Hyakatuki splashed across the sky, I turned my SLR camera upward and never looked back! Transitioning out of film in the early 2000's, I continued over the years to try to improve my ability to photograph celestial events.</p> <p></p> <p>I have viewed many websites and blogs, and have learned from each one of them. I am not the best at this hobby (there are many fine artists and astronomers who do better) but what success I've had I am willing to share with the local community. In addition, I use this hobby in education and public outreach to teach basic astronomy to children and adults of all ages.</p> <p>I will also share technical detail on how I do things and take pictures, and am always open for suggestions and comments on doing better.</p> <p>Soon, we will add a section to leave comments and address questions. In the mean time, enjoy the site.</p> <p>I wish to acknowledge my spouse Linda, my brother William, and my son Stephen for helping me pursue this hobby and build this site.</p> <p>Brian M.

Whether you live in a light polluted city, or have dark country (or mountain) skies, figuring out where stars and planets are can be very discouraging. However, here is a fun project that you can do to help yourself become familiar with the night sky. It involves a tiny bit of work on the internet, and some simple photographs taken at night right in your back yard or perhaps out in the country away from city lights. The project will help you read a star map, and possibly trace your own constellations in night photographic skies. Sound like fun?</p> <p>To show how that works, I have a couple of files and pictures I will share here. The photography involves a simple tripod for your camera (cell cameras work great too) and the ability to remotely trigger a 15 to 60 second night time exposure without touching the camera shutter. (In other words, if you use a timer or a remote shutter release, your hand won't induce vibration and cause the camera to mechanically move when you press the shutter button and make the picture fuzzy).</p>"},{"location":"photography/constellationoverlays/#overlay-of-southern-constellations","title":"Overlay of Southern Constellations","text":"<p>The first set of photos I took were from a November 2014 trip to Queenstown, New Zealand. I had never seen the Southern Constellations in my life, so ther than the \"southern cross\" and \"upside down Orion\", I couldnt figure anything out. I simply took some wide angle pictures at night of the southern skies near my hotel room. Once I came home, I searched the internet for a simple southern hemisphere star chart, and compared my pictures to those charts. Using power point (or Photoshop  or the free GIMP program), and by adjusting the darkness and contrast of my pictures, I then slowly drew in the constellations. Here is a before/after picture of what that looked like. Notice in the second photograph, the familiar northern constellation of  \"Orion\" is upside down, an artifact of taking the picture from \"down under!\"</p>"},{"location":"photography/constellationoverlays/#original-photograph-1-18-mm-lens-nikon-d700-30-second-exposure-queenstowwn-nz","title":"Original Photograph 1 (18 mm lens, Nikon D700, 30 Second Exposure, Queenstowwn, NZ.)","text":""},{"location":"photography/constellationoverlays/#original-photograph-1-with-southern-constellation-overlays","title":"Original Photograph 1 With Southern Constellation Overlays","text":""},{"location":"photography/constellationoverlays/#original-photograph-2-18-mm-lens-nikon-d700-30-second-exposure-queenstowwn-nz","title":"Original Photograph 2 (18 mm lens, Nikon D700, 30 Second Exposure, Queenstowwn, NZ.)","text":""},{"location":"photography/constellationoverlays/#original-photograph-2-with-southern-constellation-overlays","title":"Original Photograph 2 With Southern Constellation Overlays","text":""},{"location":"photography/constellationoverlays/#overlay-of-northern-constellationswith-meteors-too","title":"Overlay of Northern Constellations...With Meteors too!","text":"<p>On August 12, 2016 I decided to try to photograph some meteors using the same setup for constellation photography.

Again, I did two overlays, each with the camera slightly positioned differently. Notice I also captured a Perseids meteor in each photograph, a bonus!

Many people new to astrophotography become frustrated with overcast or cloudy nights, but forget that daytime viewing, even with broken clouds, provides a great opportunity to observe the sun if you have the correct and safe solar filters. Typically filters added to the lenses of existing SLR Cameras is relatively low cost. (For instance, a typical lens eye-safe solar filter between 50-80 mm will run $60-80 on amazon or thousand oaks optical.) In addition, one of the most beautiful natural events is the solar eclipse. In this section, we'll cover some basics on solar eclipses, and provide detailed references to those seeking information on photographing the upcoming Great American  Eclipse of April 8, 2024.

These are (1) The moon's \"orbital nodes\" intersect with, or are very close to intersecting with the ecliptic plane of our solar system. Since our moon's orbit is tilted 5.14 degrees from this ecliptic, we dont have solar and lunar eclipses every month. But when the moon's orbital node lines up with a New Moon (for solar eclipses) or full moon (for lunar eclipses) this offers the opportunity to view these events if you happen to be in the right place to view them. Since Lunar eclipses are covered in my Lunar Observing section, let's focus here on solar eclipses. First, to introduce the concept of a total eclipse, here is a video I created processed from ~260 individual images during the Great American Eclipse of August 17, 2017.

There are actually two instruments being pointed at the sun, one is a single lens reflex (SLR) NIKON D7100 camera attached to a Nikon 80-400 mm zoom lens set to 400 mm. The lens also has a special solar filter screwed in to protect both the human eye and the camera sensor from the suns intense rays. The second instrument is a solar Hydrogen Alpha telescope, which I'll discuss latter. Both instruments are attached to a tracking device called a \"declination/right ascension\" tracking system. I have a separate discussion describing how this works, but for now, it is a device, once aligned, which will track the sun without continuously moving the camera manually, like you would have to with a standard tripod.

Annular eclipses happen, just like regular solar eclipses, when the moon is new and the orbital nodes line up. However, since the moon's orbit around the earth is elliptical, sometimes in earth's orbit the moon is too far away to completely cover the surface of the sun in an eclipse. At its maximum coverage, there is left an \"annulus\" or a \"ring of fire\" that's left uncovered. Annular eclipses happen about 58% of the time, total eclipses like the 2017 eclipse happen about 42% of the time. Amazingly, since the moon's shadow is so small, a total or annular eclipse is visible over only a tiny portio of the Earth's surface.  On average, at any one place on earth, the odds of experiencing a total or annular eclipse is once in 360 years. So why did Albuquerque New Mexico get one on May 20, 2012 and October 14, 2023 after only 11 years. Remember I said \"on average\".
