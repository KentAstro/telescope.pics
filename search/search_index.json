The purpose of this website is to share the results of my lifelong interest in astrophotography! I've been interested in astronomy since my teen years, and spent decades juggling an engineering career with skywatching. In 1996, when Comet Hyakatuki splashed across the sky, I turned my SLR camera upward and never looked back! Transitioning out of film in the early 2000's, I continued over the years to try to improve my ability to photograph celestial events.</p> <p></p> <p>I have viewed many websites and blogs, and have learned from each one of them. I am not the best at this hobby (there are many fine artists and astronomers who do better) but what success I've had I am willing to share with the local community. In addition, I use this hobby in education and public outreach to teach basic astronomy to children and adults of all ages.</p> <p>I will also share technical detail on how I do things and take pictures, and am always open for suggestions and comments on doing better.</p> <p>Soon, we will add a section to leave comments and address questions. In the mean time, enjoy the site.</p> <p>I wish to acknowledge my spouse Linda, my brother William, and my son Stephen for helping me pursue this hobby and build this site.</p> <p>Brian M.

Whether you live in a light polluted city, or have dark country (or mountain) skies, figuring out where stars and planets are can be very discouraging. However, here is a fun project that you can do to help yourself become familiar with the night sky. It involves a tiny bit of work on the internet, and some simple photographs taken at night right in your back yard or perhaps out in the country away from city lights. The project will help you read a star map, and possibly trace your own constellations in night photographic skies. Sound like fun?</p> <p>To show how that works, I have a couple of files and pictures I will share here. The photography involves a simple tripod for your camera (cell cameras work great too) and the ability to remotely trigger a 15 to 60 second night time exposure without touching the camera shutter. (In other words, if you use a timer or a remote shutter release, your hand won't induce vibration and cause the camera to mechanically move when you press the shutter button and make the picture fuzzy).  </p>"},{"location":"photography/constellationoverlays/#overlay-of-southern-constellations","title":"Overlay of Southern Constellations","text":"<p>The first set of photos I took were from a November 2014 trip to Queenstown, New Zealand. I had never seen the Southern Constellations in my life, so ther than the \"southern cross\" and \"upside down Orion\", I couldnt figure anything out. I simply took some wide angle pictures at night of the southern skies near my hotel room. Once I came home, I searched the internet for a simple southern hemisphere star chart, and compared my pictures to those charts. Using power point (or Photoshop  or the free GIMP program), and by adjusting the darkness and contrast of my pictures, I then slowly drew in the constellations. Here is a before/after picture of what that looked like. Notice in the second photograph, the familiar northern constellation of  \"Orion\" is upside down, an artifact of taking the picture from \"down under!\" </p>"},{"location":"photography/constellationoverlays/#original-photograph-1-18-mm-lens-nikon-d700-30-second-exposure-queenstowwn-nz","title":"Original Photograph 1 (18 mm lens, Nikon D700, 30 Second Exposure, Queenstowwn, NZ.)","text":""},{"location":"photography/constellationoverlays/#original-photograph-1-with-southern-constellation-overlays","title":"Original Photograph 1 With Southern Constellation Overlays","text":""},{"location":"photography/constellationoverlays/#original-photograph-2-18-mm-lens-nikon-d700-30-second-exposure-queenstowwn-nz","title":"Original Photograph 2 (18 mm lens, Nikon D700, 30 Second Exposure, Queenstowwn, NZ.)","text":""},{"location":"photography/constellationoverlays/#original-photograph-2-with-southern-constellation-overlays","title":"Original Photograph 2 With Southern Constellation Overlays","text":""},{"location":"photography/constellationoverlays/#overlay-of-northern-constellationswith-meteors-too","title":"Overlay of Northern Constellations...With Meteors too!","text":"<p>On August 12, 2016 I decided to try to photograph some meteors using the same setup for constellation photography. This time, I turned my camera north east (NE) of my home driveway, and started snapping pictures about 2:30am in the morning. Again, I did two overlays, each with the camera slightly positioned differently. Notice I also captured a Perseids meteor in each photograph, a bonus! You might capture an airplane (red blinking light trail) or even a Sattelite if you're lucky. </p>"},{"location":"photography/constellationoverlays/#original-photograph-1-18-mm-lens-nikon-d7100-34-second-exposure-iso-200-0230-edt-dayton-ohio","title":"Original Photograph 1 (18 mm lens, Nikon D7100, 34 Second Exposure, ISO 200, ~0230 EDT, Dayton Ohio)","text":""},{"location":"photography/constellationoverlays/#original-photograph-1-with-northern-constellation-overlays","title":"Original Photograph 1 With Northern Constellation Overlays","text":""},{"location":"photography/constellationoverlays/#original-photograph-2-18-mm-lens-nikon-d7100-20-second-exposure-0300-edt-dayton-ohio","title":"Original Photograph 2 (18 mm lens, Nikon D7100, 20 Second Exposure, ~0300 EDT, Dayton, Ohio.)","text":""},{"location":"photography/constellationoverlays/#original-photograph-2-with-northern-constellation-overlays","title":"Original Photograph 2 With Northern Constellation Overlays","text":""},{"location":"photography/constellationoverlays/#more-constellations-coming","title":"More Constellations Coming!","text":""},{"location":"photography/deep-sky/","title":"Deep Sky Photography","text":"<p>More coming soon!</p>"},{"location":"photography/innerplanettransits/","title":"Mercury and Venus Transits","text":""},{"location":"photography/innerplanettransits/#transit-of-mercury-november-11-2019","title":"Transit of Mercury November 11, 2019","text":""},{"location":"photography/innerplanettransits/#transit-of-venus-june-6-2012","title":"Transit of Venus June 6, 2012","text":""},{"location":"photography/lunar/","title":"Lunar Eclipse Photography","text":""},{"location":"photography/lunar/#total-lunar-eclipse-of-28-29-september-2015-from-dayton-ohio","title":"Total Lunar Eclipse of 28-29 September 2015, From Dayton Ohio","text":""},{"location":"photography/lunar/#total-lunar-eclipse-of-january-20-21-2019-from-dayton-ohio","title":"Total Lunar Eclipse of January 20-21, 2019 From Dayton Ohio","text":""},{"location":"photography/lunar/#99-total-lunar-eclipse-of-18-november-2021-from-dayton-ohio","title":"99% Total Lunar Eclipse of 18 November 2021, From Dayton Ohio","text":"<p>More coming soon!</p>"},{"location":"photography/planetary/","title":"Planetary Photography","text":""},{"location":"photography/planetary/#jupiter-rotating-with-europa-moon-transit-10-12-nov-2023","title":"Jupiter Rotating with Europa Moon Transit (10-12 Nov 2023)","text":"<p>More coming soon!</p>"},{"location":"photography/planetaryconjunctions/","title":"Photographs of Planetary Conjunctions","text":""},{"location":"photography/planetaryconjunctions/#jupiter-and-saturn-great-conjunction-of-december-2020","title":"Jupiter and Saturn Great Conjunction of December 2020","text":"<p>More to come</p>"},{"location":"photography/solar/","title":"Daytime (Solar) Observing","text":""},{"location":"photography/solar/#great-american-total-solar-eclipse-17-august-2017","title":"Great American Total Solar Eclipse 17 August 2017","text":""},{"location":"photography/solar/#brian-next-to-his-solar-eclipse-instruments","title":"Brian Next to his solar eclipse instruments","text":""},{"location":"photography/solar/#annular-solar-eclipse-of-14-oct-2023","title":"Annular Solar Eclipse of 14 Oct 2023","text":"<p>Albuquerque, NM</p>"},{"location":"photography/solar/#check-out-this-presentation","title":"Check out this presentation","text":"<p>The art and science of eclipse photography</p> <p>More coming soon!</p>"}]}
